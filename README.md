Spiel is a simple object (a typescript namespace in reality but ðŸ¤« ),
in it, there's `ex`(to execute a class), `Loader`(an object to load elements), `Entity`(an object to create a class entity) and `Game`(to start the game)

## How to install Spiel?
with npm. `npm i spiel-engine` or `yarn add spiel-engine` (yes, spiel is already used)

with Game of course!
```js
